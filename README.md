# 1D-Board-Game-Solver

An implementation to solve a 1-D board game where at any index i, the player may move a[i] spaces left or right. The player wins by landing on a 0.

  This implementation begins by starting at index 0, and tries to determine if the game is solvable by starting at     position 0. 

  To do this, we recursively go through each possible path that we can take at each position starting at index 0.
